# Day 1, 01/04/2020 - Single Number

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

**Note**:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1**:

<code>
Input: [2,2,1]

Output: 1
</code>

**Example 2**:

<code>
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4
</code>
