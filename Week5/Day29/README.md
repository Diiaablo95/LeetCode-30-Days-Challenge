# Day 29, 29/04/2020 - Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.

**Example 1**:

<code>
Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6
</code>

**Example 2**:

<code>
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

        -10
        / \
       9   20
      /     \
     15      7

Output: 42
